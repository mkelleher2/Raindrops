Raindrops
=========

**Story: **
You are a farmer in a magical land.  A storm came and swept up all your corn, and now it is falling from the sky.  You can't let it all of it hit the ground, or you can't sell it!  Be careful of the evil flying pigs who are coming to eat your corn!

**Instructions: **
Use your mouse to control the basket in order to catch the falling corn.  Each ear of corn will add one point to your score, but each pig you catch will decrease your score by ten.  To make matters worse, if you catch three pigs, it is game over.  In order to win, you must have a score of at least 50 points by the time the 100th ear of corn hits the ground.
To restart the game, just hit the R key at any time

**Issues: **
At random times, the start button will not work, but all you have to do is press the R key a couple times to get the button to start working.
